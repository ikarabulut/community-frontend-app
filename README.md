Community App

This is my first project completed through Actualize coding bootcamp. Community is a one-stop shop to help empower your local community without all of the noise caused by other social sites.

Community is built on a Rails backend utilizing a Postgres database. The frontend is done using Vue.js and Bootstrap.

This project was a first taste into the real world of true full-stack development. From the initial design phase through testing and deployment I worked on this project solo. Perhaps basic in its current form but this MVP has the foundation to scale to a very functional web app.


The following document were created during the design phase. They are incomplete as they were created to build upon a decent foundation and not be flying by the seat of my pants while developing.
